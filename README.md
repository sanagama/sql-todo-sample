# SQL Server sample apps - for Linux, MacOS and Windows #

## What's here? ##

A simple "Todo list" sample app for each of the language/ORM/Framework/web-server stacks below running on Linux, MacOS and Windows that shows you how to use these stacks with [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server-2016/) and [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/sql-database/).

* C# sample app: uses [AngularJS]() as the front-end, [ASP.NET 5](http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/conceptual-overview/aspnet.html) with [EF7](https://docs.efproject.net/en/latest/) as the ORM, hosted in [Kestrel](https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer) running on [.NET Core](http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/conceptual-overview/dotnetcore.html)
* (Coming soon!) Java sample app: uses [AngularJS]() as the front-end, [Spring MVC](https://spring.io/docs) with [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/) as the ORM, hosted in [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) running on the [Java runtime environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
